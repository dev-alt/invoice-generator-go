# Business System Design

## 1. High-Level Design (HLD)

### 1.1 Overview

This document outlines the design of a comprehensive business system to manage various aspects of a business, including customer relationships, inventory, orders, projects, finances, marketing, and employee management. The system will be built using a microservices architecture, with separate services responsible for specific domains.

### 1.2 System Architecture

The system will follow a distributed microservices architecture, with services communicating via REST APIs and potentially using asynchronous messaging for certain operations. A central API Gateway will act as a single entry point for client applications.

### 1.3 Components

**1.3.1 Client Applications:**

*   **Admin Portal (Web):**  For internal users to manage customers, products, orders, employees, and other data. Built with React, Angular, Blazor, or a similar framework.
*   **Customer Portal (Web):** For customers to view their orders, invoices, and manage their profiles. Built with a similar technology as the Admin Portal.
*   **Employee Portal (Web):** For employees to access their information, track time, view tasks, etc.
*   **Mobile App (Optional):** A mobile app for customers or employees (iOS and Android). Can be built using React Native, Flutter, or native technologies.

**1.3.2 API Gateway:**

*   A single entry point for all client applications.
*   Handles routing requests to the appropriate backend services.
*   May also handle authentication, rate limiting, and other cross-cutting concerns.
*   Technology: Nginx, Envoy, or a cloud-based API Gateway service.

**1.3.3 Microservices:**

*   **Identity Service:** Manages user authentication and authorization.
*   **Notification Service:** Handles sending notifications (email, SMS, etc.).
*   **Customer Service:** Manages customer data.
*   **Lead Management Service:** Manages leads and sales pipeline.
*   **Communication Service:** Logs and manages customer communications.
*   **Product Service:** Manages the product catalog.
*   **Inventory Service:** Tracks inventory levels and stock movements.
*   **Order Service:** Processes orders and manages order status.
*   **Invoice Service:** Generates and manages invoices.
*   **Shipping Service (Optional):** Handles shipping calculations and label generation.
*   **Project Service:** Manages projects and tasks.
*   **Time Tracking Service:** Tracks time spent on projects and tasks.
*   **Expense Service:** Records and manages business expenses.
*   **Payment Service:** Handles payment processing.
*   **Email Marketing Service:** Manages email marketing campaigns.
*   **Social Media Service (Optional):** Manages social media interactions.
*   **Employee Service:** Manages employee data.
*   **Payroll Service (Optional):** Handles payroll processing.
*   **Reporting Service:** Generates reports and dashboards.

**1.3.4 Databases:**

*   Each microservice may have its own database (polyglot persistence) or share a database with clear schema separation.
*   Database technologies: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, or others, depending on the specific needs of each service.

**1.3.5 Message Queue (Optional):**

*   Used for asynchronous communication between services.
*   Technologies: RabbitMQ, Kafka, Azure Service Bus, AWS SQS.

### 1.4 Data Flow

1. Client applications interact with the system through the API Gateway.
2. The API Gateway routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
3. Microservices interact with each other via REST APIs or through the message queue for asynchronous operations.
4. Microservices store and retrieve data from their respective databases.
5. The Reporting Service aggregates data from other services to generate reports and dashboards.

## 2. Low-Level Design (LLD)

*   Database: PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or similar.

**2.3.5 Interactions with Other Services:**

*   **Order Service:** The Invoice Service may be called by the Order Service to automatically create an invoice when an order is placed or completed.
*   **Customer Service:** The Invoice Service retrieves customer information to populate the invoice.
*   **Payment Service:** The Invoice Service updates the invoice status to "paid" when a payment is received from the Payment Service.
*   **Notification Service:** The Invoice Service may trigger the Notification Service to send an invoice notification to the customer.

### 2.4 ... (Other Services)

The LLD for other services would follow a similar pattern:

*   **Responsibilities:** What the service does.
*   **API Endpoints:** How other services or applications interact with it.
*   **Data Model:** The structure of the data it manages.
*   **Technology Stack:** The technologies used to build the service.
*   **Interactions with Other Services:** How it integrates with other parts of the system.
*   **Security Considerations:** Specific security measures for the service.

**Example: Order Service**

*   **Responsibilities:** Manages the order lifecycle, including order creation, updates, tracking and completion.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /orders`
    *   `GET /orders`
    *   `GET /orders/{id}`
    *   `PUT /orders/{id}`
    *   `PATCH /orders/{id}/status`
*   **Data Model:** `Order`, `OrderItem`, `OrderStatusHistory`
*   **Technology Stack:** .NET Core, EF Core, PostgreSQL
*   **Interactions:**
    *   **Customer Service:** Retrieve customer details.
    *   **Product Service:** Get product information.
    *   **Inventory Service:** Check stock and update after order placement.
    *   **Invoice Service:** Create an invoice for the order.
    *   **Payment Service:** Process payment for the order.
    *   **Shipping Service:** (Optional) Initiate shipping.
    *   **Notification Service:** Send order confirmations, updates, etc.

**(Continue this pattern for all other services)**

### 2.5 Database Design

*   Each service will have its own database or a dedicated schema within a shared database.
*   Database schemas will be designed based on the data models defined for each service.
*   Use appropriate data types, indexes, and constraints to ensure data integrity and performance.
*   Consider using a database migration tool (e.g., EF Core Migrations) to manage schema changes.

### 2.6 Security Considerations

*   **Authentication:** All API requests (except for public endpoints like login/register) will require a valid access token.
*   **Authorization:** Implement role-based or permission-based authorization to control access to resources and operations within each service.
*   **Data Validation:** Validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
*   **HTTPS:** Use HTTPS for all API communication to encrypt data in transit.
*   **Password Hashing:** Store password hashes using strong, one-way hashing algorithms.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.

### 2.7 Deployment

*   Each microservice will be containerized using Docker.
*   Container orchestration will be managed using Kubernetes (or a similar platform like Docker Swarm).
*   Use a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps) to automate the build, testing, and deployment process.

### 2.8 Monitoring and Logging

*   Implement centralized logging for all services.
*   Use a monitoring tool (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog) to track application performance, resource usage, and error rates.
*   Set up alerts for critical events (e.g., high error rate, service downtime).

## 3. Future Enhancements

*   **Caching:** Implement caching at various levels (e.g., API Gateway, service level) to improve performance.
*   **Advanced Analytics:** Implement more sophisticated analytics and reporting capabilities, potentially using a data warehouse or data lake.
*   **Machine Learning:** Integrate machine learning models for tasks like fraud detection, product recommendations, or customer segmentation.
*   **Internationalization:** Adapt the system to support multiple languages and currencies.

This is a detailed HLD and LLD, providing a solid foundation for your business system. Remember that this is an iterative process. You'll likely refine the design as you start building and encounter new requirements or challenges. Good luck!
